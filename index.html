		<p> Q2. The styles variable is creating an empty object. From there, inside the curly brackets, various keys are set and contain js objects themselves. The conditional statement is making sure only point data will be altered by the style script underneath. This function resulted in my map switching from blue, classic point icons to clear circles. <br>
		    Q4. Feature refers to the actual geojson feature which contains each individual stations's data. Layer refers to what is rendered on the map, styling and all. <br>
			Q5. layer.options.fill seems to be a boolean operation which results in true or false while layer.getLatLng outputs the features' latitude and longitude as the name suggests. <br>
			Q6. The circles marking my stations have gotten much larger an dthere is no longer a fill of colour inside. </p>
